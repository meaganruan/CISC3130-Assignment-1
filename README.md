# CISC3130-Assignment-1
Assignment 1 : Top Streaming Music Artists
Csv File picked: TOP 200 from United states 

Deleted the first line of the csv file (because it wasn't needed).

Replaced the commas (,) in the csv file with a semicolon (;). There were 5 items that had commas from the csv file.

The csv file is already in chronological (most-least) order based on the streams and top songs (positions).

Printed outputs into a separate text file.

I chose to use linked lists because it was easier to use since there isn't a fixed size for it.
